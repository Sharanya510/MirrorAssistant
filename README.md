Built an application that highlights flaws such as facial expressions, hand gestures and the frequency with which fillers are used, and assists the user in preparing for an interview or a presentation, among many other things. It analyses facial expressions and body language in real time. It uses TensorFlow to determine the userâ€™s facial expression and hand gestures, as well as the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API to track the fillers used by the user and show the attributes on the dashboard that we create.

Business value: With the new wave of unprecedented times, almost everything is being done online including but not limited to Interviews. This particular project would help a person in building confidence and analyzing their performance. We can also use it as an additional tool to evaluate a video recording, maybe during exams (such as speaking section in TOEFL, IELTS) or during pre-recorded interviews(such as compass group).
